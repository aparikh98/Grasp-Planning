# Grasp Planning
In this lab, we work on related topics about grasp. We plan grasp on different objects, execute each grasp on Baxter robot, and compare the success rate on the physical system with the success rate predicted by several grasp quality metrics.
A video of Baxter executing various grasps can be found on YouTube.
